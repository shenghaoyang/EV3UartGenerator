 *
 * This library contains some C++ routines that can be used to generate
 * bytes to be sent to the EV3 for use in the EV3 UART sensor protocol.
 *
 * For further information, please consult the following pages:
 * - \ref Framing
 * - \ref Magics
 *
 * \warning This library currently relies heavily on GCC defined builtins
 * and macros, for bit operations, as well as endianess conversion operations.
 * When compiling on another compiler, do note possible compatibility issues.
